    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Let’ see in this blog post the new possibility offered by <strong>.NET Core 3.0 preview 2</strong> to load and unload assemblies at run time using <strong><a href="https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/master/src/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/Runtime/Loader/AssemblyLoadContext.cs#L14" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AssemblyLoadContext</a></strong>.</p><a id="more"></a><p>You can read more about it on the <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/master/Documentation/design-docs/assemblyloadcontext.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dotnet / coreclr github repository</a>. You can also see the progress of the .NET Core team on that particular topic on the <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/projects/9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unloadability Github project page</a>.</p><blockquote><p>Here are some of the scenarios that motivated this work:</p><ul><li>Ability to load multiple versions of the same assembly within a given process (e.g. for plugin frameworks)</li><li>Ability to load assemblies explicitly in a context isolated from that of the application.</li><li>Ability to override assemblies being resolved from application context.</li><li>Ability to have isolation of statics (as they are tied to the LoadContext)</li><li>Expose LoadContext as a first class concept for developers to interface with and not be a magic.</li></ul></blockquote><p>In our case, the idea of this tiny project is the following:</p><ul><li>Watch a C# source code file for any modification using Rx and the FileWatcher</li><li>On any change on that file, load it in memory as text</li><li>Compile the file using Roslyn into an assembly which is kept in memory</li><li>Execute the entry point of the assembly</li><li>Unload the assembly</li></ul><p>We will start with a simple hello world application, what else 😉 and we will allow the main application to pass some arguments to the dynamically compiled assembly.</p><p>First, we are using some Rx code to observe the file, I won’t go into that detail because it is not the purpose of that post. The code is coming from <a href="https://github.com/g0t4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wes Higbee</a> from the repository <a href="https://github.com/g0t4/Rx-FileSystemWatcher" target="_blank" rel="noopener">g0t4/Rx-FileSystemWatcher</a>.</p><p>We are using Rx-FileSystemWatcher to observe the <em>Sources</em> folder and filter for <em>DynamicProgram.cs</em>. When this file is changed, we trigger the build, load the assembly generated, find the entry point and invoke it passing “France” as the first parameter.</p><p><div style="clear:both;"></div><script src="//gist.github.com/1ea03376d0ef2a4da3358ab2629cccf2.js?file=Program.cs"></script></p><p>The main program delegates the compilation to the <em>Compiler</em> class, which is using Roslyn to compile the C# file <em>DynamicProgram.cs</em>. If there are some compilation errors, those are displayed on the console output. Otherwise, the compilation result is a <em>Hello.dll</em> returned as a byte array.</p><p><div style="clear:both;"></div><script src="//gist.github.com/1ea03376d0ef2a4da3358ab2629cccf2.js?file=Compiler.cs"></script></p><p>Then, the main program delegate to the <em>Runner</em> class which is in charge of loading and executing the entry point of the just compiled new assembly.<br>We are marking the method <em>LoadAndExecute</em> with <strong>[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)]</strong> so that the method cannot be inlined and to ensure that nothing would be kept alive.</p><p><div style="clear:both;"></div><script src="//gist.github.com/1ea03376d0ef2a4da3358ab2629cccf2.js?file=Runner.cs"></script></p><p>We are loading the assembly using our own simple implementation of <strong>AssemblyLoadContext</strong>, this is just to mark that the context is collectible. So that we can unload the assembly using the method <strong>AssemblyLoadContext.Unload()</strong>.</p><p><div style="clear:both;"></div><script src="//gist.github.com/1ea03376d0ef2a4da3358ab2629cccf2.js?file=SimpleUnloadableAssemblyLoadContext.cs"></script></p><p>In fact, the unloading does not happen immediately, it will wait that the GC collect the assembly. This is why we are calling <strong>GC.Collect()</strong> and <strong>GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers()</strong> in the <em>Execute</em> method. This is not mandatory but in our case, we want to be sure that the previous assembly is unloaded before compiling and loading the new one.</p><p>Let’s run the application, change the file Program.cs in the folder Sources and see it working 😎</p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurentkempe/DynamicRun/master/doc/screenshot.png" title="Running"><p>This is opening some new capabilities which we might explore in some new posts!</p><p>You can access to the whole project on Github, <a href="https://github.com/laurentkempe/DynamicRun" target="_blank" rel="noopener">laurentkempe/DynamicRun</a>.</p><p>Finally, you can read even more about it on “<a href="https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/a7cbc5c8d1bd48cafec48ac50900ff9e96c1485c/Documentation/project-docs/unloadability-howto.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Using and debugging unloadability in .NET Core</a>“ and can also have a look at this interesting project  <a href="https://github.com/natemcmaster/DotNetCorePlugins" target="_blank" rel="noopener">natemcmaster/DotNetCorePlugins</a> which starts to talk about the same topic on “<a href="https://github.com/natemcmaster/DotNetCorePlugins/issues/16" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Make plugins unloadable</a>“.</p>]]></content>

My goal was to see something new and learn a bit about how .NET Core is built and gain some new experience.<br><a id="more"></a></p><p>I heard about the online Hackathon on a tweet of Karel Zikmund <div class="twitter-wrapper"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/ziki_cz/status/999804438104625153" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a></blockquote></div><script async defer src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p><p>Then reading about it on the <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/wiki/Hackathon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Github page</a> linked to the tweet I decided to participate.</p><p>I wanted to start with a really small thing because I wasn’t sure about the time I had, and I wanted to be sure to finish it!</p><p>I decided to go with <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CoreFX</a> because it seemed easier than <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CoreCLR</a>. I also had a look to <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/corefxlab/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CoreFxLab</a>. And I might implement something there later as there is some migration to <a href="https://benchmarkdotnet.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Benchmark.DotNet</a> which I would also like to learn a bit about.</p><p>I joined the <a href="https://gitter.im/dotnet/corefx-hackathon?utm_source=badge&amp;utm_medium=badge&amp;utm_campaign=pr-badge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gitter chat</a> which proved to be really helpful.</p><p>Then I picked the <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/19624" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issue #19624, Remove conditional compilation in System.Diagnostics.Tracing</a> from CoreFX.</p><p>I went and started to read <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/wiki/New-contributor-Docs#contributing-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contribution guide</a> and started by installing the tooling, making a fork and clone of the CoreFX repo! All went quite well, even if the documentation could be improved in some places.</p><p>I tried to have the tests running inside Visual Studio, but after some pains and no success with <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/?fromMenu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ReSharper</a> and <a href="(https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/">Visual Studio</a>, I asked some help on the gitter which <a href="https://github.com/ViktorHofer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Viktor Hofer</a> <a href="https://gitter.im/dotnet/corefx-hackathon?at=5b1259f5f9f2e56cf234c485" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provided kindly</a>. You need to use the command </p><figure class="highlight plain"><figcaption><span>Running tests from MSBuild</span></figcaption><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">msbuild /t:RebuildAndTest</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>By running the tests I found an issue with one tests and quickly guessed that it was because my Windows 10 Pro installation is in en-US and I set my first day of the week to Monday! So I reported the <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/30074" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issue on Github</a>. The issue went through a discussion in the team and was finally fixed after being first rejected. I have to say that I agree that when someone clones a repository and run the tests, then everything should be working even in a weird setting like mine.</p><p>Back to my pull request, <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/30071" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Remove FEATURE_ETLEVENTS conditional compilation</a> which was super easy, nothing really hard when you just need to remove conditional compilation. I just had to disable some Visual Studio plugin which format the code, especially removing extra spaces at the end of lines, which I was surprised to see on some files.</p><p>Finally after reviews and final approval from <a href="https://github.com/stephentoub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stephen Toub</a> the pull request was merged and will be part of .NET Core 3.0!</p><p><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1839/29090676488_e79f80d854_o.png" alt="Pull Request merged"></p><p>So in the end, I was able to fix one issue due for the hackathon, created one issue which was fixed by the team and had some fun and some learning participating in this online Hackathon!</p><p>Thanks for organizing it and thanks to the people from the team which was present and helped us!</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since Microsoft went to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/update/waas-quick-start" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Windows as a service</a>, so since Windows 10, I fully re-install my development machine, a Surface Book, with each main release of Windows.</p><p>As I hate to lose time, I searched a way to automate it, so that it is fast, repeatable and does the work, not me.<br><a id="more"></a></p><p><strong>TL; DR;</strong> (Spoiler) Install your development environment tools with one click on a hyperlink!</p><p>Since long, I am using <strong><a href="https://chocolatey.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chocolatey</a></strong>, <strong>the package manager for Windows</strong>, to install some of my tools. I even created an installation of <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LaurentKempe.GitDiffMargin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Git Diff Margin</a>, my Visual Studio extension displaying live changes of the currently edited file on Visual Studio 2012+ margin and scrollbar. Note to me, update the package to the latest version of Git Diff Margin.</p><p>That’s already a fantastic step forward, you type one command line like this</p><blockquote><p>choco install git -y</p></blockquote><p>and you get Git installed without doing anything, except typing the command! No need to search on which website you need to download the software, download it, maybe extract it to finally be able to run it and click next-next-next (eh Cédric). Just one command on the command line and you are done. Great, no?</p><p>But after re-installing my machine this way a first time and a second time I wanted more automation. So I decided to dig deeper in a tool I found also a long time ago but never took the time to use; <strong><a href="https://boxstarter.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boxstarter</a>: repeatable, reboot resilient Windows environment installations made easy using Chocolatey packages</strong>. Seems to exactly match what I wanted to achieve for the next level of automation.</p><p>So I searched some examples on Github and cooked my own script which I open sourced and called it <strong><a href="https://github.com/laurentkempe/Cacao/blob/master/PrepareMyCacao.ps1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cacao</a></strong>. A nice name, no :D?</p><div class="figure center" style="width:375;"><a class="fancybox" href="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4616/40521281581_57a9b1d503_o.jpg" title="Cabosse de cacaoyer, Martinique" data-caption="Cabosse de cacaoyer, Martinique" data-fancybox="martinique" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="fig-img" src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4616/40521281581_3d775063cc.jpg" style="width:375;height:500;" alt="Cabosse de cacaoyer, Martinique"></a><span class="caption">Cabosse de cacaoyer, Martinique</span></div><p>So now, when I have installed my Windows 10 machine from scratch I just need to install Boxstarter, download my script and launch it! A very nice step forward indeed.</p><p>Wait can’t we do better, there is still quite some things to do by hand, and you need to remember those things!<br>What do you think of being able to click on a hyperlink, click on OK then everything would be installed for you by little pixies while you do something else? That would be just fantastic. The best is that it is possible!</p><p>You can see such a link on <a href="https://github.com/laurentkempe/Cacao/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cacao README.md file</a> search for the text ‘Install my tools!’.</p><p>This link is built as following</p><figure class="highlight html"><figcaption><span>Cacao install hyperlink</span></figcaption><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">a</span> <span class="attr">href</span>=<span class="string">'http://boxstarter.org/package/nr/url?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurentkempe/Cacao/master/PrepareMyCacao.ps1'</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line">  Install my tools!</span><br><span class="line"><span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="name">a</span>&gt;</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>So easy and so powerful. You append the hyperlink to the raw URL of your script to an URL which will install Boxstarter, and that does the trick!</p><p>So now we are ready to install development environment tools by one click on a hyperlink! What do you want more?</p><p>During the Build2018 Microsoft got interested in that topic, which is great, and you can read about it in their blog post “<a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/commandline/2018/05/08/join-us-for-a-hot-cup-o-chocolatey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Join us for a hot cup o Chocolatey!</a>“ and on their Github repo <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/windows-dev-box-setup-scripts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">windows-dev-box-setup-scripts</a>.</p><p>One fantastic side effect is that now I can also update all my tools by running one command</p><blockquote><p>choco upgrade all -y</p></blockquote><p>Like they say, there’s never been a better time to be a developer!</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After running a first console app on my Raspberry Pi 3, I had to try ASP.NET Core and API. Two weeks ago when I posted <a href="http://laurentkempe.com/2017/04/03/Dotnet-Core-app-running-on-raspberry-pi/">“.NET Core console app running on Raspberry Pi”</a>, I could make API working, but I had no chance with MVC. Today it worked!</p><a id="more"></a><p>This post will describe all steps I had to go through to have an ASP.NET Core MVC application running on my Raspberry Pi 3.

      &lt;p&gt;After running a first console app on my Raspberry Pi 3, I had to try ASP.NET Core and API. Two weeks ago when I posted &lt;a href=&quot;http://laurentkempe.com/2017/04/03/Dotnet-Core-app-running-on-raspberry-pi/&quot;&gt;“.NET Core console app running on Raspberry Pi”&lt;/a&gt;, I could make API working, but I had no chance with MVC. Today it worked!&lt;/p&gt;

Currently, the RASPBIAN distribution, which is the mostly used, is not supported but it seems that it will be soon the case according to this <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/447" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Github issue on dotnet / core</a>.</p><p>Download <a href="https://ubuntu-mate.org/download/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubuntu MATE 16.04.2 LTS for Raspberry Pi</a>, then extract the image out of the archive.</p><p>To install it on your microSDHC, the best is to use <a href="https://chocolatey.org/packages/win32diskimager" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Win32 Disk Imager</a> which you can install using Chocolatey with the command ‘<em>choco install win32diskimager</em>‘.</p><p>Then just write the image you extracted on your microSDHC using Win32 Disk Imager, like this:</p><p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2822/32957708953_4ff95b973b_o.png" alt=""></p><p>Wait a couple of minutes then plug the microSDHC in your Pi and boot it, then follow the installation instruction and create your user.</p><p>Currently, there is no .NET Core SDK running on ARM processor, the CPU architecture of the Pi. So you will have to write and compile your program from another machine, in my case I run on Windows.</p><p>Now to simplify all the operations I installed a SSH server on the Pi to make it easy to access it remotely and copy files from my Surface.</p><p>To install the SSH server, run a shell, and run the following commands</p><p><div style="clear:both;"></div><script src="//gist.github.com/75b6b70d1bcdc3b4caa030160dbcb018.js?file=installSSSHServer"></script></p><p>Then we will need to install some .NET Core native prerequisites for Ubuntu as explained on the <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/Documentation/prereqs.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Github dotnet / core documentation</a>.</p><p><div style="clear:both;"></div><script src="//gist.github.com/cf534c59a094654491e28b0d1701738a.js?file=prerequisites"></script></p><p>You will need the IP of your Pi, so use the command ‘<em>ifconfig</em>‘ which will output something like that</p><p><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3816/32957721773_5f33093414_o.png" alt=""></p><p>Then back to your PC, install <a href="https://chocolatey.org/packages/putty" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Putty</a> using ‘<em>choco install putty</em>‘ and <a href="https://chocolatey.org/packages/winscp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WinSCP</a> using ‘<em>choco install winscp</em>‘.</p><p>Configure both Putty and WinSCP to connect to your Pi using the IP address you’ve got from the ifconfig command</p><p>Now that we have the Pi running the right Linux distribution on it and we can connect to it easily from our computer, it is time to create a first .NET Core project. For sure, we will start with the famous Hello World.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/dotnet/cli/tree/master" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Install .NET Core 2.0 SDK</a>, I used the Windows x64 version 2.0.0-preview1-005685 which I downloaded as a zip. Unpack it on your hard drive in a folder named dotnet, then create another folder at the same level called hello and create a new console application:</p><p><div style="clear:both;"></div><script src="//gist.github.com/0b60cae1c6c10ccab6ed3f167e766cb5.js?file=create_project"></script></p><p>Edit the file hello.csproj created in the folder.

You will need to update the RuntimeFrameworkVersion with the version that you can find on the page .NET Core Runtime &amp; Host Setup Repo / <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup#daily-builds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daily Builds</a> then <strong>find Ubuntu 16.04 (arm32)</strong> and get the version, in my <strong>case 2.0.0-preview1-005685</strong>.</p><p><div style="clear:both;"></div><script src="//gist.github.com/809deab02a08a52ee17f3cb03a7b39c1.js?file=hello.csproj"></script></p><p>Then run, and publish</p><p><div style="clear:both;"></div><script src="//gist.github.com/98813ec107d827fd3ef3cb6178d36caf.js?file=run_publish"></script></p><p>Finally, you will get the publish results in the folder <strong>.\hello\bin\Debug\netcoreapp2.0\ubuntu.16.04-arm</strong> which you can easily upload to your Pi using WinSCP previously installed.</p><p>You need then to set the hello executable to have the execution rights on the Pi, which you can also do easily from WinSCP</p><p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2806/33821762845_f3033ff9db_o.png" alt=""></p><p>The final step is to run you hello executable on the Pi, which you can do using Putty over SSH then, or by having your Pi connected to a monitor, mouse, and keyboard!</p><p>Here is the result</p><p><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3856/32957716323_e196bc13f0_o.png" alt="Result"></p>]]></content>

A node is a Linux host or virtual machine used to deploy and run containers. It is the equivalent of what we did with the docker-machine command line on the post “<a href="http://laurentkempe.com/2016/06/08/Deploying-Docker-containers-running-ASPNET-Core-RC2-to-Microsoft-Azure-Cloud/">Deploying Docker containers running ASP.NET Core RC2 to Microsoft Azure Cloud</a>“. You can get all the instruction on the page “<a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-cloud/getting-started/your_first_node/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deploy Your First Node</a>“.</p><p>In our case we created the following node:</p><p><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8141/27745012403_54637b1580_o.jpg" alt="Docker Cloud node"></p><p>Currently, we have a machine, a node in Docker Cloud wording, so we are ready to deploy our containers on that node. We could <strong>create a service</strong>, which is a container, or a group of containers from the same Docker repository. But we are more interested in <strong>creating a stack</strong>,  which specifies a group of services that make up an application, similar to Docker Compose. As we have seen in “<a href="http://laurentkempe.com/2016/06/20/Free-HTTPS-certificates-for-Docker-containers-running-ASPNET-Core-RC2-on-Microsoft-Azure/">Free HTTPS certificates for Docker containers running ASP.NET Core RC2 on Microsoft Azure</a>,” our application is currently made of two components served as two containers: </p><ol><li>NGINX, reverse proxy and setting up Let’s Encrypt certificates</li><li>Kestrel delivering our ASP.NET Core 1.0 hipchat connect web application</li></ol><p>To create our stack, we are re-using our docker-compose.yml file set up in the previous post</p><p><div style="clear:both;"></div><script src="//gist.github.com/d529fcdf54724a900533f26fa4a768c3.js?file=docker-compose.yml"></script></p><p>which we modify slightly to describe our stack</p><p><div style="clear:both;"></div><script src="//gist.github.com/29165d3e6874cf4cc27d83ead5b8bd28.js?file=stackfile.yml"></script></p><p>The only difference, except the reordering, is to instruct automatic redeployment of the hipchatconnect container when an update of its image occurs in Docker Cloud registry, with the following line</p><blockquote><p>autoredeploy: true</p></blockquote><p>After creating the stack file and hitting the deploy button, we see the result of our stack with its two containers running on our node on Microsoft Azure!</p><p><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8737/27745039973_30f15757da_o.jpg" alt="Docker Cloud stack"></p><p>Let’s have a break a moment to see what we have achieved at the moment and what remains to accomplish our goal to have a proper CI/CD pipeline and be able to deploy to production from a simple commit/merge in source code repository.<br>We have at the moment all the infrastructure ready. We have a node which is a machine in Azure running our application which is composed of two Docker containers.<br>So the last point is to connect this infrastructure to our source code repository which is a git repository on Github.</p><p>To do that we will use the <em>Build</em> part offered by Docker Cloud and the repositories. A repository is a collection of tagged images. When you create a service, you choose an image to use to create containers. You can read more about it on the page “<a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-cloud/builds/repos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Docker Cloud repositories</a>“<br>Then we will enable the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-cloud/builds/automated-build/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">autobuild</a> by connecting it to our Github repository which will trigger a new build with every git push to our source code repository.</p><p><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8782/28360642885_2f32f1a280_o.jpg" alt="Docker Cloud Github Repository Build"></p><p>Pretty impressive results in such a little effort and short time! I have built some CI/CD in the past, but it wasn’t that easy, we see clearly the potential of today’s tooling that gives us so much power as software engineers!</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Following my previous posts on <a href="">ASP.NET Core RC2, Docker and HipChat Connect add-on</a> and <a href="">Deploying Docker containers running ASP.NET Core RC2 to Microsoft Azure Cloud</a> I needed, as promised in the last post, to come with a solution to secure the whole with an HTTPS certificate!<br><a id="more"></a></p><p>So the overall goal is to have my Hipchat Connect add-on written in C# and ASP.NET Core RC2 hosted in a Linux Docker container running in Microsoft Azure and secured by an HTTPS certificate.</p><p>I am following for quite some time the <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Let’s Encrypt</a> project which is just perfect for what I want to do!</p><blockquote><p>Let’s Encrypt is a new Certificate Authority: It’s free, automated, and open.</p></blockquote><p>Now that I know that I can get in an automated way and for free an HTTPS certificate, the question is how should I architecture the solution? The answer is quite simple. As I use Docker, I can plug another Docker container with a reverse proxy in front of my current container which runs the <a href="https://github.com/aspnet/KestrelHttpServer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kestrel</a> web server hosting our C# and ASP.NET Core RC2 code.</p><div class="figure center" style="width:;"><img class="fig-img" src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/8/7494/27687906621_782bf08e81_o.jpg" alt="Reverse proxy & Kestrel containers architecture"><span class="caption">Reverse proxy & Kestrel containers architecture</span></div><div style="clear:both;"></div><p>Ok which reverse proxy then? First, I had a look to <a href="https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NGINX</a> which I knew then found <a href="https://traefik.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Traefik</a>. I liked very much the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvAz9mVx5TI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DEVOXX presentation, in French</a>, from its author <a href="https://twitter.com/emilevauge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emile Vauge</a> and it, supports Let’s Encrypt out of the box.</p><p><div style="clear:both;"></div><div class="video-container"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/QvAz9mVx5TI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></p><p>I tried Traefik but till now could not make it work the way I wanted, so back to NGINX. But I do not give up.</p><p>I searched for a Docker image which runs NGINX and can be configured to get automatically and renew Let’s Encrypt certificates! I finally found <a href="https://github.com/SteveLTN/https-portal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HTTPS-PORTAL</a> which was looking very promising.</p><blockquote><p>A fully automated HTTPS server powered by Nginx, Let’s Encrypt and Docker.</p></blockquote><p>To achieve the architecture I described before I started to use <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Docker compose</a> so that with one command I can start/stop both containers either locally or on Microsoft Azure!</p><p>Following the <a href="https://github.com/SteveLTN/https-portal#quick-start" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documentation of HTTPS-PORTAL</a> I finally got the whole working with the following docker-compose.yml file</p><p><div style="clear:both;"></div><script src="//gist.github.com/d529fcdf54724a900533f26fa4a768c3.js?file=docker-compose.yml"></script></p><p>I fell into a trap, so be aware of it! I got first NGINX 502 Bad gateway error. I thought that the docker-compose.yml part for hipchat had to declare an exposed port. In fact, it doesn’t work like that. We are using links so that both containers are on the same internal network and that they can communicate. But that happens on their internal ports, so in our case for Kestrel and our Docker image, it is the port 5000. To realize that I had to connect to the container using</p><div class="alert info"><p>> docker exec -i -t CONTAINER /bin/bash</p></div><p>I installed wget, got the IP of the Kestrel container and tried to connect to it using wget also to get an error. That’s the moment I realized about the port!</p><p>To have <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/how-it-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Let’s Encrypt set up our HTTPS server</a> and have it automatically obtain a browser-trusted certificate, without any human intervention, we need first to own a domain and to configure the DNS so that it resolves to the public IP of our virtual machine.</p><p>But first of all we need to configure our Azure IP address to be static</p><p><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7340/27762904595_2258b2973e_o.png" alt="Microsoft Azure static IP"></p><p>And don’t forget to open the 443 HTTPS port on the Microsoft Azure firewall.</p><p>Now we are ready to start both containers using Docker compose</p><p><div style="clear:both;"></div><script src="//gist.github.com/d529fcdf54724a900533f26fa4a768c3.js?file=docker-compose.exe"></script></p><p>To be able to see what’s going on in the container we can use <em>docker ps</em> then <em>docker logs</em></p><p><div style="clear:both;"></div><script src="//gist.github.com/d529fcdf54724a900533f26fa4a768c3.js?file=docker-ps"></script></p><p><div style="clear:both;"></div><script src="//gist.github.com/d529fcdf54724a900533f26fa4a768c3.js?file=docker-logs"></script></p><p>Finally, we can use a web browser to access our public API now through HTTPS.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Following my previous post on <a href="https://laurentkempe.com/2016/05/16/ASP-NET-Core-RC2-Docker-and-HipChat-Connect-add-on/">ASP.NET Core RC2, Docker and HipChat Connect add-on</a> I wanted to learn the next step which is to deploy my Docker container on the Microsoft Azure Cloud!<br><a id="more"></a></p><p>Due to a <a href="https://docs.docker.com/machine/drivers/azure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">known issue</a> and to avoid to have issues with credentials you need to follow the instructions on the following page “<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-windows-create-aad-work-id/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Creating a Work or School identity in Azure Active Directory to use with Windows VMs</a>“</p><blockquote><p>KNOWN ISSUE: There is a known issue with Azure Active Directory causing stored credentials to expire within hours rather than 14 days when the user logs in with personal Microsoft Account (formerly Live ID) instead of an Active Directory account. Currently, there is no ETA for resolution, however in the meanwhile, you can <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-windows-create-aad-work-id/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create an AAD account</a> and login with that as a workaround.</p></blockquote><p>Now to get ready to deploy we need first the following:</p><ol><li>Get an Azure account on <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Azure</a></li><li>Get Azure subscription id from Subscriptions link</li></ol><p><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/8/7435/27355205412_b5b2f751fa_o.jpg" alt="Azure subscription id screenshot"></p><p>Then we need to create a machine on the Azure cloud which will host our Docker containers. For that we will use Docker Machine, you can read more about it on this web page “<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-linux-docker-machine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Use Docker Machine with the Azure driver</a>“. </p><p>Using Docker for Windows, I execute the following docker-machine command to create the machine</p><script src="//gist.github.com/b46c5bfa339e1fd42b35d87191432c41.js?file=docker-machine_create.log"></script><p>After a couple of minutes, we can check on the Azure cloud portal, All resources menu, that Azure created everything for us</p><p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7006/27177992480_1b3056ce8f_o.jpg" alt="Azure ressources screenshot"></p><p>Finally, we need to get the configuration to talk to that machine, and it’s Docker daemon</p><script src="//gist.github.com/b46c5bfa339e1fd42b35d87191432c41.js?file=docker-machine_env.log"></script><p>Then execute the last line which will configure our local environment  </p><blockquote><p>&amp; “C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\Resources\bin\docker-machine.exe” env hipchatconnect | Invoke-Expression</p></blockquote><p>Now each docker commands will be executed by the machine hosted on Azure cloud.<br>Easy and awesome!</p><p>Next step is to have a Docker container to deploy! We will use the container from my previous post “<a href="http://laurentkempe.com/2016/05/16/ASP-NET-Core-RC2-Docker-and-HipChat-Connect-add-on/">ASP.NET Core RC2, Docker and HipChat Connect add-on</a>“.</p><p>First, we need to build an image using the following command</p><script src="//gist.github.com/b46c5bfa339e1fd42b35d87191432c41.js?file=docker_build.log"></script><p>Then we need to get the public IP of our machine on the Azure portal </p><p><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/8/7370/26847519653_66bc0cc208_o.jpg" alt="Azure public ip"></p><p>We can run the container on Azure cloud with</p><blockquote><p>docker run -d -p 80:5000 -e NGROK_URL=’<a href="http://40.68.122.128&#39;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://40.68.122.128&#39;</a> hipchatconnect</p></blockquote><p>To be able to connect to our connector on the HTTP port 80, we will need to configure the firewall</p><p><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/8/7375/27420164226_eaa9aa3d94_o.jpg" alt="Azure firewall configuration"></p><p>and finally, connect to it!</p><p><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/8/7515/27383357301_ef760d740b_o.jpg" alt="Docker container running in Azure Cloud result"></p><p>What a great experience to be able to create a machine in the Azure Cloud from the command line and deploy our software so quickly!</p><p>Now that it works we will need to tackle the next issue, which is to expose the container through https because <a href="https://developer.atlassian.com/hipchat/about-hipchat-connect" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HipChat Connect</a> needs it so that the add-on can be installed in <a href="https://www.hipchat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HipChat</a>.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This weekend ASP.NET Core RC2 was starting to show up! And it finally was <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/webdev/2016/05/16/announcing-asp-net-core-rc2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released today</a>. Get it fresh from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/net/core" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. We had here a long three days weekend with quite awful gray clouds and cold weather for the season, so a perfect excuse to get started!<br><a id="more"></a><br>The first project I wanted to port to ASP.NET Core RC2 is something I began to work on some time ago when <a href="https://www.hipchat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atlassian HipChat</a> announced their new <a href="https://developer.atlassian.com/hipchat/about-hipchat-connect" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Connect</a> framework!</p><p>I had it working with <a href="https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NancyFx</a>; it is quite small and hacky at the moment, but at least an interesting little project to port on a weekend. The second part I wanted to have is to be able to make it run in a <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Docker</a> container so that I will be able to deploy it on our Linux server at work.</p><p>So I installed the <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/2016/05/16/announcing-updated-web-development-tools-for-asp-net-core-rc2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ASP.NET Core Tooling Preview</a> for Visual Studio 2015 and created a new ASP.NET Core Web Application (.NET Core) in C#, for sure!</p><p><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7477/26962278712_2de5a67090_o.png" alt="New Project"></p><p>picked up Web API</p><p><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7649/26988369191_7b0369cf04_o.png" alt="New ASP.NET Core Web Application (.NET Core)"></p><p>Finally, I started the port which took me something like two to three hours!</p><p>I ended up with the following code for the <em>Program.cs</em> file. The interesting part is the <strong>UseUrls()</strong> which I didn’t have while trying to make it run with Docker, then it wasn’t bound to the right network, and the application wasn’t accessible outside of the Docker container.</p><script src="//gist.github.com/38b53ab6c53b15a9630580b6115d2067.js?file=Program.cs"></script><p>Then I had some difficulties to have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CORS</a> working the way I wanted, but in fact, it ended up being an issue of returning JSON from my HipChat Connect GetGlance method. So it is quite easy to configure it in the <em>Configure()</em> method.</p><script src="//gist.github.com/38b53ab6c53b15a9630580b6115d2067.js?file=Startup.cs"></script><p>Next step was to port from NancyFx module to ASP.NET Core RC2 controller, which was quite natural with the <em>Route</em>, <em>HttpGet</em>, <em>HttpPost</em>, <em>FromBody</em> and <em>FromQuery</em> attributes. The main point of interest is the <strong>ValidateToken()</strong> method which validates a JWT token using a <strong>SymmetricSecurityKey</strong>, and that wasn’t straight!</p><script src="//gist.github.com/38b53ab6c53b15a9630580b6115d2067.js?file=HipChatConnectController.cs"></script><p>To be able to test the HipChat Connect add-on, I needed to be able to expose my application from my local development machine to the internet so that I can add the add-on to one HipChat room and for that I used <a href="https://ngrok.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ngrok</a>!</p><p>Using the same ngrok command I used for NancyFx with ASP.NET Core RC2 gave me as a result “<em>Http Bad Request error while calling your end point!</em>“</p><blockquote><p>ngrok http -bind-tls=true 8080</p></blockquote><p>To be able to make it work with ASP.NET Core RC2 I had to fine tune the command so that the host header is adapted, then it worked!</p><blockquote><p>ngrok http -bind-tls=true -host-header=”localhost:52060” 52060</p></blockquote><p>And to finish, I wanted to have the project running in a Docker container using <a href="http://laurentkempe.com/2016/04/30/Docker-for-Windows-Beta-review/">Docker for Windows</a>. To achieve that goal I used the following <em>Dockerfile</em></p><script src="//gist.github.com/38b53ab6c53b15a9630580b6115d2067.js?file=Dockerfile"></script><p>Built the Docker image with</p><blockquote><p>docker build -t hipchatconnect .</p></blockquote><p>Then started the Docker container with</p><blockquote><p>docker run -d -p 5000:5000 –name hipchatconnect hipchatconnect</p></blockquote><p>Checked that I could access my first ASP.NET Core RC2 project running in Docker with the following url:</p><blockquote><p><a href="http://docker:5000/hipchat/atlassian-connect.json" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://docker:5000/hipchat/atlassian-connect.json</a></p></blockquote><p>You might be also interested to read the following post <a href="https://blog.docker.com/2016/05/docker-net-core-clr-rc2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Docker and .NET Core CLR Release Candidate 2”</a> by <a href="https://blog.docker.com/author/mano/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mano Marks</a>.</p><p>To expose the container using ngrok I had to use:</p><blockquote><p>ngrok http -bind-tls=true -host-header=”docker:5000” docker:5000</p></blockquote><p>After adding the add-on to one of our room, the final result is a <a href="https://developer.atlassian.com/hipchat/getting-started#GettingStarted-AddstatustoHipChatroomsviaGlances" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HipChat Connect Glance</a> showing the number of our TeamCity builds and their states.</p><p><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7598/26989288911_6a7439863d_o.png" alt="HipChat Connect add-on based on ASP.NET Core RC2"></p><p>As a conclusion, to that especially long post, I am so happy that I could finally play with the ASP.NET Core RC2 bits, run a little Web application on my Windows 10 machine but also in a Linux Docker container using Docker for Windows! I love those two technologies and see a bright future for both of them. I am also delighted that Microsoft made .NET Core an open source project.</p>]]></content>

Started with the command line and all its commands like docker start,  stop, ps, etc… Then I tried Kitematic and even compiled it from the source before it was supporting Windows! Then Docker Toolbox.<br><a id="more"></a><br>Two weeks ago I got access to Docker for Windows Beta, so first I uninstalled all the previous things I installed like VirtualBox, boot2docker, Docker Toolbox, even if it is supported to run in parallel with Docker for Windows. I was delighted to read that it supports Hyper-V which is a much better solution for us on Windows. Especially developers who need to run phone emulators which most of the time use Hyper-V! No more reboot tricks to turn it on or off.</p><p>My first impressions are very positive! The overall experience is much easier, and you can get started very fast. Downloading and running your first Docker images is done in some minutes now!</p><p>You now get a nice icon in the Windows notification area </p><p><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1673/26661310031_9bc569e24a_o.png" alt="Docker for Windows Tray icon"></p><p>Currently, it lets you control only a few things like Memory allocation, Automatical start, Checks for update but also, the interesting Manage shared drives</p><p><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1510/26661257341_11374f368c_o.png" alt="Docker for Windows Settings"></p><p>Till now the updates are coming at a good pace!</p><p>You can also use the entry Dashboard to download Kitematic which will let you control Docker through an interface and makes it even easier to download images and start/stop containers!</p><p><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1515/26701373396_487ce0187a_o.png" alt="Kitematic"></p><p>And the other great experience is that now you just start your command line and type your docker commands, and it just works!</p><p><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1538/26660797101_605058c25f_o.png" alt="Docker on the Command Line"></p><p>Another nice improvement is that now you can access your containers with a simple URL like <a href="http://docker.local:32769/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://docker.local:32769/</a> </p><p>Overall a great new experience and to me, it goes in the right direction.</p>]]></content>

It is really alpha and a quick one evening hack!</p><p>The other day my colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/gianluigiconti" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gianluigi</a> proposed to my team an alternative with a PowerShell script which you would run specifying the Pull Request id and the branch name:</p><blockquote><p>review 272 feature/1270-show-hide-panels</p></blockquote><p>Nice! The script is good but as I am spending a bit more than a day of work working on a running train with an unstable internet connection I needed something that would work offline too.

Our goal is to review the branch called feature/hipchat-connect.<br>First, we need to find the SHA1 of the previous commit of the start of the branch feature/hipchat-connect.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the past in my team, we were storing the Telerik assemblies into our SVN repository then in Git! I wasn’t happy about that for a really long time. Each releases our repository was growing much more than it was needed for nothing!<br><a id="more"></a><br>One day Telerik shipped their great WPF controls as nugets which solved half of our problem! Now the next problem was where do we store those nugets so that we can get those back. Searching a bit we found some solutions like <a href="https://myget.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">myget</a> but we wanted one which we could host on our infrastructure. After some more research, we found ou that TeamCity, could work as a <a href="https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCD9/NuGet#NuGet-UsingTeamCityasNuGetServer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nuget server</a>.</p><p>That was just perfect because we have been using TeamCity from day 1 of the project. We finally go the  second half of our solution.</p><p>You first need to activate the Nuget server on TeamCity:</p><p><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1674/26338964882_405d486347_o.png" alt="tc-nuget-server-1"></p><p>We have activated the guest account so that the Nuget feed URL is accessible without any credentials. We use it on our LAN so that’s not really an issue for us. But it also works with credentials if you want.</p><p>The way TeamCity works with Nuget server is quite easy: any artifacts resolved after a build are then available through the Nuget server.</p><p>So next step was to define how to we bring a new version of the Telerik nugets when they ship a new version.</p><p><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1441/26365113121_7f3047a0da_o.png" alt="tc-nuget-server-2"></p><p>Again easy, just configure a build which takes the .nupkg from one folder and then bundle those as a build artifact.</p><p><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1671/25828490813_5a089e7001_o.png" alt="tc-nuget-server-3"></p><p>So when Telerik release a new version we just need to upload all the .nupkg files to the folder <em>C:\Telerik\</em> and run the build!</p><p>One more step in the good direction of automation!</p>]]></content>

      &lt;p&gt;In the past in my team, we were storing the Telerik assemblies into our SVN repository then in Git! I wasn’t happy about that for a really long time. Each releases our repository was growing much more than it was needed for nothing!&lt;br&gt;

This is collecting artifacts which aren’t directly shown on the Artifacts tab:</p><p><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2836/11114221833_738e29571e_o.png" alt=""></p><p>Clicking show reveal the file we are interested about, dotCover.snapshot:</p><p><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2833/11114229113_b46ec7804e_o.png" alt=""></p><p>Something to note is that to be able to use code coverage NDepend needs the pdb files, this is why we have another artifact named PDBs.zip. And finally the third is our software with the exe and dlls.</p><p>Now that we have a build which generate the coverage file which we want to pass to NDepend, let’s create another TeamCity build which will define Snapshot Dependency and Artifact Dependency to the previous build:</p><p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7363/11114582156_0605499626_o.png" alt=""></p><p>We are extracting the exe to a NDepend folder and all dlls out of the archive Libs folder to the same NDepend folder.<br>We do the same for the pdb files so that NDepend can use the code coverage data.<br>Finally we extract the dotCover.snapshot to a dotCover folder.</p><p>Then the issue we had was that the dotCover.snapshot file is not of the format that NDepend is expecting.</p><p>So as a first build step of our NDepend build we need to convert dotCover.snapshot file, this is done using a Command Line build step and dotCover integrated in TeamCity, using the <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/dotcover/webhelp/dotCover__Console_Runner_Commands.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report command</a> and the ReportType equal to NDependXML:</p><p><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3679/11115318034_55d5175a9a_o.png" alt=""></p><p>So after that build first step we have a new converted file; dotCoverNDepend.xml which can be consumed by NDepend.</p><p>Then in the second build step we are using dotCoverNDepend.xml with the new NDepend 5.1 CoverageFiles command parameter:</p><p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7364/11115499383_e14d7b48f7_o.png" alt=""></p><p>Here is the full command</p><blockquote><p>C:\NDepend\NDepend.Console.exe “%teamcity.build.checkoutDir%\skyeEditor.ndproj” /CoverageFiles “%teamcity.build.checkoutDir%\dotCover\dotCoverNDepend.xml” /InDirs “%teamcity.build.checkoutDir%\NDepend” “C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319” “C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\WPF” /OutDir “C:\NDependOutput”</p></blockquote><p>This will create the NDepend report which we will archive as an artifact, on the General Settings of the build</p><p><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5491/11115423854_92c437b8d4_o.png" alt=""></p><p>Then you will need to define that you want to see the NDepend report as a TeamCity Report Tab, which you define by navigating to Administration &gt; Report Tabs, clicking Create new report tab and specifying</p><p><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5533/11115432286_aa8423bdc1_o.png" alt=""></p><p>Finally you will have the following NDepend report with code coverage shown for your builds</p><p><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2849/11115450035_9bf0cefdcb_o.png" alt=""></p><p>One last thing I struggled about is that the NDepend builds were not started, because I thought it was enough to configure the Dependencies, but you need to define also a Build Trigger with Trigger on changes in snapshot dependencies ticked:</p><p><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5493/11115554176_63214bac84_o.png" alt=""></p><p>Thanks to <strong>Yegor </strong>for the discussion which greatly helped as always!

&lt;p&gt;For a long time I wanted to integrated &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ndepend.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;NDepend&lt;/a&gt; on our build server so that this week I invested some time here and there to achieve that goal. I did that already a long time ago, I even wrote the documentation which you can read on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ndepend.com/Doc_CI_TeamCity.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;NDepend website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
