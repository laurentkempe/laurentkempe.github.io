It is an important date for me, because tonight the first platform built in the ecenter was switched off. For sure the end of something, but a great start for something new ([1](/lkempe/archive/2006/06/03/First-step-of-a-long-migration-weekend-reached.aspx), [2](/lkempe/archive/2006/06/05/Second-step-of-a-long-migration-weekend-reached.aspx), [3](/lkempe/archive/2006/06/08/Opening-users-access-to-the-new-ecenter-solutions-platform.aspx)).

And here is the picture of the team:
