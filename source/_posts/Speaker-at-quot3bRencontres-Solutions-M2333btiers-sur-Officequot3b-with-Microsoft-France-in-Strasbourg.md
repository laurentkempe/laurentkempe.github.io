Tuesday, 26 April I will be with [Microsoft France](http://www.microsoft.com/france/) in Strasbourg 
as a speaker for the "Rencontres Solutions Métiers sur Office".  I 
will demonstrate the tool I developed for [Tech Head Brothers](http://www.techheadbrothers.com) website based 
on VSTO 2003, Word 2003, XML Schema, XML, XSLT, Web Services secured with 
WS-Security and WS-Policy.

You might have a look at the planning [here](http://www.microsoft.com/france/msdn/office/rencontres/agenda.mspx). 
And register [here](http://www.microsoft.com/france/msdn/office/rencontres/inscription.mspx).

Surfing the site I realized that [Tech Head Brothers](http://www.techheadbrothers.com) was listed as a 
Partner, nice :-).
